# NYC Air Quality analysis [March 2004 to February 2005]
Sai Sujith Reddy / Jupalli

* This work was realized as part of the capstone project of the MS in Data Science at Pace University
* **Abstract**: Air quality is among the major determinants of human health, environmental quality, and economic expenditure. The present study is to evaluate and understand the level of air in New York, being one of the most densely populated cities in the United States. Due to high population density, heavy traffic flow, and extensive industrial activity, New York City is confronted with several environmental challenges, particularly the problem of air pollution. An inquiry of this nature will help in providing information or data-driven insights toward appropriate environmental policy and public health warnings by assessing trends of several pollutants and forecasting the future situation. The values of pollutants like CO, NOx, and C6H6 in urban areas fluctuate and prove difficult for environmental policy and public health. The work contemplates the approach toward a comprehensive air quality dataset useful in analysing the patterns, correlations, and effects related to various pollutants. The key research question regards the comprehension of changes over time in pollutants and their dependencies on environmental conditions, both in terms of temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. 
* **Dataset**:
   * Measurements of different air pollutants and weather parameters including temperature. The measurements were recorded every hour and were obtained from AirQualityUCI dataset.
   * A few important aspects are:
      *  Air Pollutants: CO, NOx, NO2 and Benzene C6H6.
      * Sensors: Tin oxide for CO, Titania for NMHC, Tungsten oxide for NOx, and indium oxide for O3
      * Climatic Condition: temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), and absolute humidity (AH)
   * â€‹Size: Total number of the entries are 9357
* The dataset is available here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/387/air+quality
* **Methodology**: Methodology used in the project with justification (to be completed at the end of the semester)
* **Results**: Results obtained in the project with 1-2 charts / images (to be completed at the end of the semester)
* **Poster** (as an image)
