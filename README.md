# NYC Air Quality analysis [March 2004 to February 2005]
Sai Sujith Reddy / Jupalli

* This work was realized as part of the capstone project of the MS in Data Science at Pace University
* **Abstract**:
* **Dataset**:
   * Measurements of different air pollutants and weather parameters including temperature. The measurements were recorded every hour and were obtained from AirQualityUCI dataset.
   * A few important aspects are:
      *  Air Pollutants: CO, NOx, NO2 and Benzene C6H6.
      * Sensors: Tin oxide for CO, Titania for NMHC, Tungsten oxide for NOx, and indium oxide for O3
      * Climatic Condition: temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), and absolute humidity (AH)
   * â€‹Size: Total number of the entries are 9357
* The dataset is available here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/387/air+quality
* **Methodology**:The project uses SARIMAX and LSTM methods of modeling air quality in New York City and forecasting its values which have specific attributes that best suit air quality data including its seasonal component, exogenous variables and time series aspects.
* **Results**: Results obtained in the project with 1-2 charts / images (to be completed at the end of the semester)
* **Poster**: (as an image)
